Real estate price analysis and forecasting plays a key role in various fields including investment, construction, finance and even everyday housing. This tutorial develops an elastic net model for residential price forecasting. This model is based on a number of spectrum parameters such as geographic location, square footage, number of bedrooms and baths, home condition, as well as room-by-room data on market trends and macroeconomic indicators.

The study will evaluate the model based on prediction accuracy and comparison with actual property prices. The developed model is expected to be effective in predicting house prices through the use of complex mathematical algorithms and machine learning.

The use of such a model can have practical applications, such as helping realtors, investors, and even ordinary people make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate. This model can also be useful for financial institutions analyzing the real estate market as part of their additional strategies.

Elastic net research models for real estate price forecasting represent an important step in the development of real estate market analytics tools, opening up new opportunities for more accurate and reliable forecasts, which in turn can ensure the stability and efficiency of this important sector of the economy.
